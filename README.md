# Car-price-analysis-using-ordinary-least-squares

Demonstration of simple linear regression using ordinary least sqaures.
The dataset was taken from kaggle.
The dataset was first cleaned and then a simple random sample of 750 rows was selected from it.
This data was then normalised and analysis was done on it.
The x variable chosen was powerPS (power per stroke) and the y variable was price.
This was just a simple project for us to understand the idea behind OLS and we are aware that linear regression might not be the best model for this problem as the residual error is quite high.
